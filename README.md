# About

The goal of this project was to consider how software development skills could be utilized in a QA role. With this goal in mind I began thinking of standalone test utilities that could be used in any environment. Additionally I wanted to learn how to work with the Selenium WebDriver framework to automate testing tasks in web applications. This project satisfied both of these objectives, as well as reinforcing key concepts taught in the computer science (CS) program at Westminster College, SLC. 

I decided to create a tool for discovering broken links within a webpage. I wanted this tool to be usable as a general purpose testing tool, be simple to use, and provide reporting on test success and/or failure. These goals fit well with the project goal of designing a QA utility and reinforcing CS coursework.



# Contents

Addins, DB_Utils, and Driver_Utils contain the external libraries as well as the database file used for this project.

src/com/brokenlinkfnider/utils/ contains the connection classes for SQLite and Selenium, if changing structure these classes may require updates.
